There are currently three inspectors that detect might download and one inspector it has internally. If Detect decides that your package manager needs an external inspector, you must either be online or have the applicable Air Gap files. Gradle Inspector The Gradle inspector is added as a dependency to a temporary gradle script file. If you are online, the Synopsys Artifactory is added as a maven repository and the inspector is downloaded by Gradle. If you are offline, the air gap inspector jar files are added as classpath file dependencies. In both cases, a custom gradle script is then run which invokes the Gradle inspector's task. The source code for the gradle inspector is located on GitHub . Docker Inspector TODO: @SteveBillings, verify this is how the docker inspector works. The Docker inspector is available as an java jar or shell script for Linux or Mac. If you are online, the Synopsys Artifactory is used to download the docker inspector jar file. If you are offline, the docker inspector jar as well as all needed docker image tars are located at the provided path. Additionally, if offline, the inspector jar will be provided and will automatically import all of the found image tars. In both cases, the located inspector jar is run which communicates with the docker installed on your system. The source code for the docker inspector is located on GitHub . NuGet Inspector The NuGet inspector is available as an independent executable for Windows or as a dotnet application for all dotnet supported operating systems. If you are online, the Synopsys Artifactory is used to download the applicable NuGet package which is then unzipped and the runtime files are located. If you are offline, the air gap inspector runtime files are simply located at the provided path.
